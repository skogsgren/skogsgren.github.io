## ...myself #

For some reason too restless to write in my native language, it just never clicked for me. Maybe it was the remnants of Rimbaud in the collective unconscious... Wait Rimbaud was French. I'll have to come up with another theory.

## ...my writing #

Oh, it's all terrible. But I think I am getting better.

## ... philosophy #

What I tell myself is interesting to me and others after three beers and a regretted cigarette.

## ... 日本語の勉強しますか？

I have an unhealthy relationship with commiting to learning. I love to start cooking, peel that sweet potato & carrot, brown that onion, but when push comes to shove I don't have the energy to stand around the stove all day for Japanese curry. For now I have decided to keep the anxiety under control by watching some Cowboy Bebop now and again w/o subtitles.
