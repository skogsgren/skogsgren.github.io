## ...myself #

For some reason too restless to write in my native language, it just never clicked for me. Maybe it was the remnants of Rimbaud in the collective unconscious... Wait Rimbaud was French. I'll have to come up with another theory.

## ...my writing #

Oh, it's all terrible. But I think I am getting better.

## ... philosophy #

What I tell myself is interesting to me and others after three beers and a regretted cigarette.
