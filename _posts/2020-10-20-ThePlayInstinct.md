>*"Insofar as he gives form to matter, and so long as he gives it, he is invulnerable to her influences; for nothing can injure a spirit except what deprives it of freedom, and Man proves his freedom by his very forming of the formless."[^1]*

Beauty, to Schiller, is the solution to the problem of duality in human nature that he perceived.  He saw that man is double-faced: the practical man (or sensuous) and the moral man (or form). Society is at clash with both these faces in different ways and the only way forward is not by revolution, but by a gradual creation of a third persona, which to Schiller is the instinct of play.

In the optimal state every person is to be educated, cultured, to be at ease with their duality: the savage, and the moral. The cultured man must make a friend out of Nature but curb its caprice. The role of art in the duality in the human condition is that of a wall: something that holds back the impulses of both extremes. Like Aristotle Schiller says that the only "virtuous" way is through the mean. Balancing the duality because you can't have one without the other. Through pure nature we feel unsatisfied and alone, while pure intellectualism makes us envious of natural desires discovered through art; ultimately leading to indifference.

Therefore the aiming toward the aesthetic is the aiming toward an ideal, an ideal of good. It is both the Aristotlean belief that where every human behavior is aimed is toward the good, as well as the Kantian belief that through right *intentions* (In lack of a better word) we bring positive change to society and the people around us and ourselves. And though we can't help but be products of our time it is our duty to accept it and try to move forward. *"The old principles will remain, but they will wear the dress of the century"*[^2] No dogma can solve the spiritual needs of humanity, only the proper - aesthetic - education of man will offer the freedom for people to stand alone.

However we are, for the most part, too occupied with desires (food, water, money, love) that we resign our beliefs and struggle for truth to higher powers. The natural disposition in human nature is to be happy and to avoid pain. The way to wisdom is through dealing with emotions, the training of our sensibility to deal with our problems first - allowing us to tackle truth next. For how could we ever hope to be kind to strangers if we can't make other natures part of ourselves? If we manage our internal world and come to terms with it it will echo outwards.

All of this strikes me as somewhat similar to when Jung speaks about the process of individuation, the connection between the two opposing sides of yourself. In Jung's case the conscious & unconscious; in Schillers the sensous & form.
