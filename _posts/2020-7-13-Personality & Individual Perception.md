We are all different, but we are also very much alike. Many theories throughout history have tried to explain - to map - exactly the ways in how we differ and how we are similar. I am not so sure that there is such a theory that fully encompasses this ideal, at least not by using our human limitations to come up with them; but what I do believe, and what has occupied my thoughts for the last few days is the theory of the individuality of perception. What if the main reason why our personalities differ so much is because of the way we perceive basic information from our senses?

Now, this all sounds very similar to the MBTI personality type test, which is exactly where these thoughts came from. Now the MBTI personality test, developed by Katharine Cook Briggs and her daughter Isabel Briggs Myers, inspired by Jungian ideas, is not uncontroversial. A quick web search brings up a myriad of articles criticizing the validity of dividing humanity into sixteen types, like [this one](https://www.theguardian.com/science/brain-flapping/2013/mar/19/myers-briggs-test-unscientific) from the Guardian. Many of the criticism can be boiled down to that the MBTI test does not predict job performance, and that the type can fluctuate depending on when you take the test. I think those are valid concerns, and I certainly don't think that the types themselves is the interesting part of the MBTI test. Sure they're fun, like fortune cookies are fun, but I don't think they really hold any validity in themselves, and they should certainly not be used in the workplace, that's just a dangerous precedent. No, what I think is the interesting part is the *attitudes*.

The attitudes of the MBTI is the machinery of the types themselves and can be divided into: Introversion vs. Extroversion; Sensing vs. Intuition; Feeling vs. Thinking; Perceiving vs. Judging. These also have their corresponding introverted and extroverted equivalent, so for example Fi = Introverted feeling or Ne = Extroverted intuition. Now I won't go into detail into every function,  other people have done much a better job at that, like the official article on the Myers Briggs [website](https://www.myersbriggs.org/my-mbti-personality-type/understanding-mbti-type-dynamics/the-eight-function-attitudes.htm). In short, however, you could define the functions like this: 

- **Sensing (Se/Si)** The input of sensory information. The extroverted version is more concerned with concrete data on the here-and-now while the introverted is more about comparing that concrete data to individual past experiences.
- **Intuition (Ne/Ni)** Based on the Jungian belief of the unconscious. The extroverted version is based on possibilites from the external situation while the introverted is about comparing the situation to an internal framework. This is an unconscious process.
- **Thinking (Te/Ti)** Logic thinking, the search for consistency. The external version is more concerned about external laws and interpersonal cultural values while the introverted version is more concerned about an internal logic/consistency in arguments.

Now before I go into the main point of my argument we need to bring up John Locke and his theory on knowledge in order to make sense of the argument.

### Locke's Theory Of Knowledge

>*"No Man's Knowledge here, can go beyond his Experience."* [^1]

Locke proposes that an inquiry into the theory of knowledge should be grounded in the limitation our human minds and senses puts on us. Locke holds fast that all knowledge arises from ideas, ideas that arise from experience, more specifically two types: *simple ideas* springing directly from our senses, and combinations from those simple ideas into *complex ideas*. A simple idea is *simply* an idea coming as a direct result from sensory information. Thus our ideas of certain objects is only "our" sensory reflection of that object.  This also has the implication that no idea can spring up from the mind alone, just as a blind man could never truly grasp the notion  of colors, or the deaf man of sound or music, or trying to make up a taste you've never before have tasted. The only way to do so would be to experience it. 

In short it just means that all our knowledge comes from our experience, and that different people have different perceptions of the same idea. However, while some differences are so minor that they are meaningless, like the idea of the color white, it is when they grow into complex ideas that the differences start to show. When this starts to get really interesting is when Locke applies it to language, and even more specifically, to words.

#### Words

> *"Really the truth is just a plain picture.* - Bob Dylan

To Locke all words originate from the simple ideas of the mind, and are created in the mind of the speaker in an effort for listener to understand the speaker's perception of that idea. Thus a child for example will use the word of gold only in reference to its color, because he is yet to understand its other qualities. Because for the child it doesn't matter, because he only wants to describe the color, not gold itself. But as words can only bring up images of the listener's or hearing's perception of the ideas inherent in the words, Locke suggest that all we can ever do is take from it understanding on the terms of those perceptions. The thing that limits our knowledge are our basic perceptions.

This dissonance between listener/hearer can, in my opinion, also contribute to the development of ideas. Different words bring up different ideas in different people, and the combination of those ideas into new ones is what brings progress. Like the connection between Hegel and Marx, same general line of thought, with two completely different perspectives.

### MBTI Attitudes In Lockian Terms

This brings up to mind the theory of MBTI and my purpose behind writing this: that our different personalities are based on the way we *perceive* basic sensory information, or in Lockian terms "simple ideas". At this point I must clarify that when I say *perceive* I am not talking about the sometimes unconscious process of *absorbing* sensory information but the "judging" that takes place in the mind, the placing that raw information in their corresponding meaning in relation to oneself; the process in how that particular information stays relevant to us.

So let's look at an example. Let's say we have a situation in which someone has broken the supposed rules of a society or social group. Take a doctor who treated an altruistic person instead a hateful person, say a charity worker over a Nazi. One person, if we speak in terms of MBTI attitudes might *prefer* to use his extroverted thinking in this situation and say that *"A doctor has rules for a reason, to provide equal care for everyone"*; while someone who *prefers* to use his introverted feeling might think otherwise, instead saying *"I could see myself making the same choice, and besides I think it's naive to think that every situation could be put into external rules"*. This is of course simplified to provide an example, and I have to clarify that no one only uses only his "preferred" attitude, we use all of them, all of the time. But just as I like most food, there is some dishes I keep returning to.

So, to combine this with Lockian thought would merely be the combining between MBTI attitudes and the theory of simple ideas as the basis of human knowledge. For if our senses are the basis of knowledge, and the way in which we judge the information arriving through our senses differs depending on the *attitudes* that we prefer, we are suddenly faced with a very interesting theory. And I must admit that the implications of this theory are very non-practical, but they are very fun to think about. Perhaps it could be confirmation bias, but the more I observe conversations and actions of myself and people around me these types of patterns emerge.

### Conclusion

Finally I think it is appropriate to bring up John Locke's perspective on truth. The way I interpret his use of the word is that it is found out by self-contemplation and thinking by yourself, not getting "truths" from other people. Taken directly from his epistemology, experiencing the "truth" for yourself, and getting your own perception of those simple ideas, not leaning on others perception of simple ideas, because that would be futile. 

If we agree that all knowledge has to be processed by our human senses, and that the way we *perceive* that sensory information differs on our individual preference, we come to a point where personality hinges on the way we prefer to interpret sensory information. It also means that any attempt to describe the human condition in words is by fatalist terms, meaningless. I do think however that just because something is by definition unattainable fully does not mean that the meaning in the search itself is meaningless. Just as you might hit gold when digging by the side of an abandoned railroad track in the forest you might discover something you never would've expected if you just keep digging.
