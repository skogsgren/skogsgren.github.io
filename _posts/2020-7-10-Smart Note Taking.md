Smart notetaking, as aptly named by Sönke Ahrens in his book *Smart Note Taking*, is the form of notetaking formed around concepts and the connections of those concepts to other, perhaps totally unrelated, concepts. It is the mirroring of how the brain works, not by creating new synapses, but by enforcing the connectinos between already existing ones. In order to do this (note that this is merely *my* way of doing this, also from the perspective of someone who reads mostly philosophy) I usually go by these following steps/methods.

## Active Reading

Active reading is when you constantly ask yourself questions while you read. In Mortimer Adler's appropriately named book *How To Read A Book* he goes into the importance of active reading in applying the knowledge that you absorb. There are four stages to proper reading - but only two are relevant to the "higher" levels of reading. This term could also be applied to other forms of "Active" reading, as long as it involves asking *yourself* questions while you read. This is key to extract concepts from the source; however Adler goes into more detail, and defines this:

### Analytical Reading

Analytical reading is the level above understanding the literal meaning of the sentences, it is the weaving together of the entirety into cohesive arguments and *implied* arguments and meanings. There are four basic questions that you must constantly ask yourself while reading at an analytical level:

1. What is the book about as a whole?
2. What is being said in detail, and how? Discover the main ideas, assertions and arguments to the authors particular message.
3. Is the book true, in whole or part?
4. What of it? If the book has given you information you must ask about it's significance. Why does the author think it is important for you to know these things? Is it important to you?

This is to be combined with notetaking, akin to what Sönke mentions in his book, by using your own words. The focus is on individual understanding not on rote memorization. So how does this weave in with "Smart Notetaking"?

## General Concept Behind Smart Notetaking

1. When you come up or find an idea, write it down somewhere. If you get it from a source convert it into your own words; but be sure to write down the bibliographical information.
2. Keep them in one folder and make sure they have a unique ID. Link to other notes as much as possible & keep them as small as possible (to keep them decentralized), maximizing the amounts of links. Include references at the bottom.
3. Use tags to group related notes and add them below the header. Think of the best words/phrases for you to stumble upon the note again; but remember that tags are *doors* not *corridors*, entry points to your slip box. Also create a homepage full of all tags, an index, unless the software you are using is doing that for you (Obsidian, as well as Roam I think, does this).

### Create Zettels From Reading Notes

The steps below go into detail in how I usually read something that I wish to get something out of.

1. First take notes, in your own words, that seem important to you or the subject you're researching. When taking notes start by writing the page number & then the thought.

2. When you're finished gather the notes in clusters. Ask yourself *"What was the intent in reading this, and how can I capture that best?"* These clusters don't necessarily form around the outline of the book but to any purpose you deem fitting. 

3. Writing notes from the clusters start in attempting to convert it into a singular, cohesive thought. Then decide if that thought would become too long to explain in one note. Prepare the conclusion first and then branch off to capture the concepts you want to explain.

## Conclusion

This is all a terrible generalization, and I recommend reading through both books to get a better, personal understanding of the concepts involved. This is mostly for those somewhat familiar to the concepts, but (as I was at one point) looking for how to apply it practically.
