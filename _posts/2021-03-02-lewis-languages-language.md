Lewis aims to synthesize two elements in the philosophy of language that he says most often are seen as distinct from each other, by bridging the gap between what he calls '*languages*' and '*language*'. Put in another way to describe what the connection looks like between the way that we *use* language and what language actually *is* and *does* to a population of speakers. He does so first by defining these two sides, which he presents in the form of the thesis and anti-thesis.

#### *Thesis*: 

Language is a function, going from a finite set of marks(vocal or non-vocal) to meaning. Lewis puts it as such: if $$\alpha$$ is a sentence of $$\psi$$ then $$\psi( \alpha )$$ is the meaning of $$\alpha$$ in $$\psi$$. This meaning, combined with factual information (about what can be said to be found in the set of that particular world) from this world or possible worlds yields the truth value of $$\alpha$$.

So according to the thesis language could therefore be said to be a function, output of which is meaning, and input of which are different marks put in relation to corresponding sets in possible worlds.

#### *Anti-thesis*: 

Language is a rational act, one performed on the basis of speaker intention, in a fashion somewhat similar to Grice's theory on meaning in that meaning fundamentally rests on psychological terms. It differs, however, in that the basis of that rationality rests on *convention*, and how expectation of it enables it to persist in a population of language speakers.

That intention, too, rests on a conscious desire in the speaker to affect the audience in some way. This is a fundamental point in Lewis' argument: that our intention when we use language is to produce a belief in the intended audience. In other words that our act of speaking reveals something about the speakers state-of-mind.

Lewis gives six conditions for a convention:

1. [Almost[^1]] everyone conforms.
2. Everyone believes that others conform.
3. Condition (2.) gives everyone reason to individually conform.
4. There's a preference(a preference originating from terms of epistemic/practical reasons) for conformity in everyone rather than almost everyone.
5. There are equally good alternatives to every convention.
6. Condition 1-5 express common knowledge, i.e. that: *"they are known to everyone, it is known to everyone that they are known to everyone, and so on."* (6, Lewis 1975)

This definition can be, according to Lewis, extended toward non-language contexts - like how we arbitrarily choose which side of the road to drive on to avoid collision. Lewis emphasizes that it is a *practical* choice to conform, which in this case can easily be seen: not crashing is preferable to everyone compared to crashing.

It is worth noting here a couple of things about conventions. Convention does not mean that the chosen convention is the best one, as noted by (5.) in the definition --- only that it is conformed to by the large majority of speakers. 

Convention also, as noted in the 'objections' section of the article, is not something that can explain everything about language - only things on how language works according to normal speakers of that language. For example convention does not explain how the language nor the convention itself originated, nor discrepancies(like how babies/children cannot follow convention rationally), only the way that it persists [through conformity & expectation of conformity] in normal members of a language population.

### *Synthesis*: 

Now we can return to the title of the paper. 'Languages' can be said to correlate to the thesis, and 'language' to the anti-thesis. The synthesis, or the connection between the two, holds by virtue of convention. 

Lewis says that the convention of what language to use is fundamentally a convention of trust & truthfulness in that particular language. We are truthful in that language because we trust others to do the same; which allows for successful communication.

From this he gives conditions of ordinary language use, these being kind of mirror-images of the ones found in the definition for convention:

1. An utterance considered true by a person *p* is uttered to convince another person of that truth.
2. [Everyone in] a population believes that this condition of truthfulness is conformed to.
3. Because we expect others to change their beliefs when hearing sentences (which are expected to be true) so do we conform to changing ours. This coordination is not performed, however, simply in the context of a single utterance - but it is performed in regard to all past coordination, which together has formed both parties expected truthfulness in that language. This could be seen as helping answering the question on how we *understand* new sentences. We do so, says Lewis, because of the accumulated experience of past coordination and the expected truthfulness in further coordination (this is sort of begging the question, however, on how grammar fits in to this picture of *understanding* - something that is addressed below).
4. In a population there's a preference for universal conformity, especially in regards to expected truthfulness - as that provides reliable successful communication.
5. The truthfulness convention has equally good alternatives, but it holds in virtue of conformity.
6. Condition 1-5 are common knowledge to a population.

These conditions allow Lewis to combine the thesis and anti-thesis, saying that the connection between the two holds in virtue of the condition that any given sentence exists in a language and is used according to the convention of truthfulness.

Lewis notes later that the definition of a convention together with this portrayal of what ordinary language use is inadequate in one major respect: it seems that it fails to account for compositionality, especially the argument from learnability. If a language is only constituted by sentences and their meanings, what can be said about their parts and how they make up the meaning of the sentences as a whole? Does it not seem intuitively that language must have a finite set of constituents & operations from which we can create larger sentences?

Lewis answers this by appealing to what he calls 'grammars'. Grammars are abstract [set-theoretical] objects that contain three distinct things: i) a finite lexicon mapping elementary parts to meanings, ii) a finite set of operations that provide correct syntax on how to combine smaller constituents to larger constituents - and how the new constituent derives its meaning from the previous, and iii) a representing operation that maps constituents to [vocal/non-vocal] marks. So grammar could be seen as providing the functions which assign meanings to constituents.

What a meaning for a constituent is, can be found according to Lewis, in Carnap's version of referential semantics. As Lewis puts it: *"A meaning for a name can be a function from worlds to possible individuals; for a common noun, a function from worlds to sets; for a sentence, a function from worlds to truth-values (or simply, the sets of worlds where that function takes the value truth)."* (18, Lewis 1975) This can be applied to their corresponding forms of combination. If we take a look at verb phrases (in the form of "The dog jumps" etc) : if $$\alpha$$ is a name, $$\psi$$ a sentence, and double brackets indicate semantic function(that outputs meaning) then $$[\![ \psi ]\!] = \psi ([\![ \alpha ]\!] )$$ and so on for the rest of the combination forms [^2].

This theory of grammar allows Lewis to say that compositionality is still upheld, seeing as we can define the meaning of a sentence by using its constituents. The grammar is therefore that which generates the language, and not the other way around.

Then we might ask ourselves the question: *"Then why start with discussion about 'language' and not 'grammar'?"* Because there is no way to do so while both maintaining convention and how there is general conformity in a population. What would make a population use the grammar $$\Gamma$$ if another grammar $$\Gamma '$$ solves the same problems and are practically identical/interchangeable? Lewis gives no answer to this but instead re-frames it. He says that grammars are used if and only if it is the best grammar for that particular language *in virtue of* a truthfulness convention in that particular language. Thereby separating the use of a language (its notions & its meanings) from our evaluation *of* grammars.

In regards to practicality, however, Lewis says that we needn't be worried about this conclusion, i.e. that the semantics of any given language has an unstable foundation. Lewis brings up Quine's *indeterminacy of reference* here to showcase his point: it might be true that there exists several grammars that provide a perceptibly identical function; however, that does not necessarily mean that the *practicality* worsens - possibly even the opposite  

As a last point it is worth mentioning that Lewis believed that languages and grammars and meanings were set-theoretical entities, analysis of which could be done in "complete abstraction from human affairs". The reason for why he hypostatizes these is quite simple: *"There is no point in being a part-time nominalist."* (17, Lewis 1975)

---

So, to Lewis a language is an abstract object; a set of expressions *generated* from grammar (which also is an abstract object). It allows for successful communication in virtue of convention, a convention of truthfulness between the speakers. It is upheld, too, in virtue of that convention of mutual truthfulness.

# Commentary

Bridging the gap between 'languages' and 'language' is really the answering of a single question: *"How does language allow us to successfully communicate with other people?"* Lewis says that it is found in the asking of the question of what language *does* first, and describing what it *is* after.

Put simply what language *does* to Lewis is allow us to transfer our beliefs about the world to others and what language *is* to Lewis is convention [of truthfulness]. The last one, what language *is* is the controversial one - and I think it is so for the wrong reasons.

For what is language, really, except for a means to solve problems of coordination and communication between two parties?  It is therefore as much an act as it is something independent from that act in Lewis' theory, i.e. the difference between describing language as something *in*-dependent of human activity it describes it as *co*-dependent on that activity.

So a large part of the reasons why Lewis' answer to what language *is* is seemingly such a polemic one can, I think, be partly explicated through a statement by J.L. Austin, when he says:

> *"Philosophers at least are too apt to assume that an action is always in the last resort the making of a physical movement, whereas it’s usually, at least in part, a matter of convention[^3]."* (237, Austin 1962)

Contained in Lewis' idea about the connection between 'languages' and 'language' we clearly see this emphasis on *action* first (what language *does*). It is a conscious, while at the same time unconscious decision for every normal speaker in a language population on what conventions persist in any given language. They are conventions, not in virtue of being *best*, or even that we are *conscious* of them or understand them, but only in staying *truthful* to each other (to allow for successful communication).

This seemingly undermines the possibility for a philosophical analysis of language itself. For if language to an almost universal degree can be explained by persisting convention, i.e. an *act* between two parties, how can we ever say anything about its objectivity in relation to - for example - meaning through philosophical analysis without being undermined?

This to me seems like a non-sequitur. Approaching the critique of the theory by only stating problems with one of its constituents isolated from the theory itself. Lewis' idea gains validity in virtue of it as a complete system, and not by only its atomic parts. 

Furthermore there is nothing in Lewis' theory that makes it impossible to analyze language as something independent from human affairs, Lewis even explicitly states it as such[^4]. All it says is that while language can be studied in independence one cannot describe language fully in independence from human affairs. It is after all perhaps the *most* human of affairs.

Applying Lewis' idea to the question of how language allows us to communicate with other people brings out a view on language itself that is very human, and I think, very acceptable in virtue of being so. Language allows us to communicate, because, we care about the people around us and want to successfully communicate with them, bringing forth a convention of truthfulness. In my opinion a very noble starting point to any further philosophy of language.
