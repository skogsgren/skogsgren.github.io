Jordan Peterson is undoubtedly a very smart guy, specifically in the field of psychology; however, I do have some things that really grind my gears about some of his opinions.

To me it seems that in many of his talks he speaks of the moral decline of civilization, that to him allegedly started after Descartes, Newton and other scientific philosophers. This strikes me as very similar to that of Plato, who talked of a return to tribal society in order to stop the perpetual, unavoidable moral decline. For example, in Peterson's book *Maps of Meaning* he writes:

>*“Prior to the time of Descartes, Bacon, and Newton, man lived in an animated, spiritual world, saturated with meaning, imbued with moral purpose. The nature of this purpose was revealed in the stories people told each other—stories about the structure of the cosmos and the place of man.”* [^1]
> 
>*"Now we think empirically (at least we think we think empirically), and the spirits that once inhabited the universe have vanished.”* [^1]

In these matters I think Peterson is inherently, and utterly, wrong. I don't think he's wrong in what he implicitly says, but what is implied in the meaning. It is clear that he thinks that a return to strict dogma in societal values will partly solve the human condition of existential suffering.  This return to the simple existence of *tribal magic* as Karl Popper defines it in his book *The Open Society & It's Enemies* will, in my opinion not solve the human condition. Nothing truly can. This is the vice of human existence, and I guess the bane of the philosopher. With that said, I am much more inclined towards Popper's opinion on this arrest of political/societal progress:

>*"The lesson which we thus should learn from Plato is the exact opposite of what he tries to teach us. It is a lesson which must not be forgotten. Excellent as Plato’s sociological diagnosis was, his own development proves that the therapy he recommended is worse than the evil he tried to combat. Arresting political change is not the remedy; it cannot bring happiness. We can never return to the alleged innocence and beauty of the closed society. Our dream of heaven cannot be realized on earth. Once we begin to rely upon our reason, and to use our powers of criticism, once we feel the call of personal responsibilities, and with it, the responsibility of helping to advance knowledge, we cannot return to a state of implicit submission to tribal magic. For those who have eaten of the tree of knowledge, paradise is lost. The more we try to return to the heroic age of tribalism, the more surely do we arrive at the Inquisition, at the Secret Police, and at a romanticized gangsterism. Beginning with the suppression of reason and truth, we must end with the most brutal and violent destruction of all that is human. There is no return to a harmonious state of nature. If we turn back, then we must go the whole way—we must return to the beasts."* [^2]

Maybe it is my inner optimist shining through, as I believe that human nature strives in order to be good - or at least, what you believe to be good. (There is no cure to ignorance but education)

Although, it cannot be denied that having an open society comes with enormous suffering to the individual. When life seemingly has no certainty, no security; and now with modern science, no purpose - how can we expect to find purpose ourselves? I believe, like Aristotle, that such purpose could be found in the pursuit for happiness [^3]. Essentially, that purpose for you, the individual, is to find out what things have intrinsic value to you. Peterson seems to argue that the individual can never find that purpose by himself, that he needs a extrinsic purpose - according to him - found in the tribal society of old with rigid expectations and values. Values in accordance to our biological (unconscious) inclinations. I think that it is our *moral* duty to try to rise above that, that we can do much more. This is an enormous challenge; that I won't even try to deny. But what is a mountain but a summit to climb?

However, I agree with Peterson on his opinion about God - in a sense. In his words:

> *God is “how we imaginatively and collectively represent the existence and action of consciousness across time.” God is “that which eternally dies and is reborn in the pursuit of higher being and truth.” God is “the highest value in the hierarchy of values.” God is the “voice of conscience.” God is the “source of judgment and mercy and guilt.” God is the “future to which we make sacrifices and something akin to the trascendental repository of reputation.” God is “that which selects among men in the eternal hierarchy of men.”* [^4]

I think this ties very well into my personal belief that the concept of God is inherent in the human condition, or perhaps, inherent in the concept of human language. When we speak (I am not sure though of how it works in feral humans or animals) we need to distinguish between two things; what is sacred, and what is profane. On a beach there are million grains of sand and small rocks, yet we still find some rocks that we find more beautiful than others. Thus, we need the ability to define that one object which resides in the same class of words as another has more value than another. This allows us to have emotional connections to an otherwise nihilistic world full of boring rocks and sticks. I think that we filled that metaphysical void shortly after our sentience, an explanation for our existence, our purpose in life. You could even suggest that the concept of God is our attempted solution to the intrinsic suffering in human existence. And from what I can see, this is similar to Jordan Peterson's stance as well. 

Many of Peterson's beliefs seem to based on people the likes of Freud and Jung, and thus many opinions are derivatives of the idea that it is our *sexuality* that decides many/most (or all) of our actions and goals, and of course,  psychoanalysis which says that human nature can be understood in terms of unconscious drives. In this I don't think he is that wrong. That all of our decisions are in various degree based on our biology - our genome and hormones - is not something that can, in my opinion, be denied. Where I disagree with Peterson is that this necessarily limits our ability to improve our societal values, our norms, ourselves. Mankind has always been shown to have the potential to rise above it's own limitations, and I believe it is our duty to *try* to fulfill that goal. We act from the cards from which we are dealt.

As we come to his political views I seriously start to dislike what he is saying. In his other fields of discussion I think that he has opinions with valid arguments, specifically when he speaks of self-improvement in terms of stoic & Aristotelian philosophy. 
However, when he says that there is a covert agenda behind the majority of western institutions today I can't help but not take it seriously, and as a result, make me lose respect for his opinions as a whole. He calls the term: *Postmodern neo-Marxism*. Let's explore that term, and dissect it:

- **Marxism** The idea that society should be understood by a class struggle between the workers and capitalists, and that the workers will eventually revolt.

-  **Post-modernism** When Peterson says it he's referring to postmodern philosophy, or philosophy after 1945. Postmodern philosophy, really simplified, is the skepticism over if human beings really can now anything at all. More specifically, it is the skepticism over modernism.

-  **Modernism** The late modernists were philosophers who attempted to explore philosophical questions in a scientific way - compared to the early modernists, like Hume, who were empirical and suggested that nothing that couldn't be proven empirically couldn't be proven at all. 

This leads to a dilemma. On one hand we have Marxism, which states a fundamental modernist worldview that tries to explain the human condition in economic terms; on the other, one that says that fundamental truths about the human conditions are impossible. These two together don't make sense. But Peterson doesn't want the expression to make sense, not if you go by the way he uses it. Not only the world of academia, student activists and HR departments are included in the underground society; but also LGBT activists, feminists and civil rights activists. 

In his term *Post-modern neo-Marxism* he also frequently includes identity politics as a part of it. 

- **Identity politics** When you advocate for the rights for specific groups, mostly used for marginalized groups; such as women, people of color, and gay and trans people. Or in other words, that you presuppose that these groups are good basis for political organization. 

But post-modernists would say that all these groups are social constructs, and are, by their nature, oppressive. For example the postmodern feminist would for instance say that the whole concept of womanhood is potentially oppressive. *Postmodern neo-Marxism* is thus an umbrella term for Peterson, a nonsensical term to round up the groups that he doesn't approve of in one, scary *Marxist* package. 

This term ties together with what really grinds my gears about Peterson: the ambiguous way in which he speaks. He is consciously nebulous with his word choice so that he can mean two things at the same time, providing him plausible deniability when someone calls him out. Like the interview he did with Kathy Newman on BBC. 

In the same interview he implies in his argument about natural hierarchies that because hierarchies are natural in lobster societies, therefore some natural hierarchies must exist in human societies. But no one, on either side of the political spectrum would ever deny this - it is just an enormous straw man. He uses it to disapprove of the theory of Western patriarchy. But you could use this argument to approve of any hierarchy, no matter of how unjust. 

In my opinion, society is undoubtedly man-made. Everything around us in society, the inequality between gender, race and economic is a problem to be solved, or at least, must be attempted to solve.
