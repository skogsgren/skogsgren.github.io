The goal of any political ideology is to give to people an idea of progression, a goal to move toward. All ideologies also give an account of how society is constituted, what needs to change to give way for the proposed idea of progress, and what needs to remain static. Something that I find interesting is the way that human nature is portrayed in political ideologies[^1], and how that human nature stands in comparison to science. 

In left-wing politics a human being is portrayed as an autonomous being capable of bringing change into the world, change through the transformation of fundamental structures of society - like in our preconceived notions about gender, economics, family etc. Something also worth noting here is that while we are autonomous we are also at the mercy of those systems around us to form us into the persons that we become. We are therefore autonomous, but at the same time codependent on our environment around us. 

In right-wing politics a human being is also portrayed as an autonomous being capable of bringing change into the world, but not through changing the fundamental structures of society(which some right-wing people either don't believe exist or that they are immutable aspects of human nature). And here the point that I am trying to make fits in: that this view, that humans are capable of bringing change into the world through appeasing to our intrinsic rationality, i.e. that we, our egos, are supposedly independent from the environment, is a dangerous way of looking at the world. Part of me wants to go as far to claim that right-leaning politics is un-scientific in its proposal of progress, compared to what science has taught us about human psychology. The reason for me being so harsh in my wording here is two-fold: i.) right-wing politics emphasizes reason as the harbinger of progress, which is a fundamentally flawed assumption and ii.) right-wing politics ignores the idea that we are formed by our habits, by our ruts, rather than vice-versa, an idea that I find dangerous to ignore. 

*Reason* is the pinnacle of humanity in right-wing politics. The reason for this is because if we want to promote a political ideology that is based on ultimate individuality then we need something to base that individuality on. Otherwise we would have to be forced to conclude that we are affected by our environment, which in turns means that we would be forced to accept that there are systems, which would mean that right-wing politics would be forced to come with a solution to that problem - which stands contradicting the fundamental tenets of that ideology. Therefore we need something, something innate in every human being to base that politic theory on, and that something is *reason*.

The problem with this I think is obvious. Reason is really bad if we use it the way that we think that we use it. In their 2018 book *The enigma of reason* Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber laid out their theory on reason: we form intuitions first, independent from reason, and then use reason to rationalize those intuitions. So reason is primarily used to rationalize and justify oneself in the eyes of others; as well as to spot gaps in other peoples' reason. Throughout history and in experiments this has been proven to be the case. It evolved not for us to become autonomous individuals, independent from our surroundings, but it evolved to solve problems in social interaction (like the detection of cheaters, hence the ability to spot gaps in other peoples' reasoning). So the real 'enigma of reason' is not reason itself, but the way in how we perceive it.

From here it is easy to see why this brings a problem to the fundamental idea behind right-wing politics: that we are autonomous in virtue of the power of reason. Perhaps one could respond by saying that we instead of changing a *societal structure* to better accommodate and work with this idea of reason, that we promote *individual* use of reason, perhaps by education; and then leaving the rest up to individual responsibility. This is something that I think has some merit, but undermines itself due to its premise. In accepting that we sometimes have to be taught something through an institution it seems that you also accept that human nature, is in some degree malleable. This is too contradictory to the way most right-wingers perceive human nature.

But let us put that aside for now. Perhaps it is true that we can form a new understanding and usage of reason in the political sphere without the need of change(or acceptance of the existence of) in the fundamental structures in society. This still ignores a common assumption of human nature: that we consciously form our habits, rather than the other way around. This idea is something that philosophers throughout history have played with throughout history, but for the sake of argument let's focus on Confucius. Confucius said that nothing is innate when we are born. What we become depends on how we live our life, and what kind of situations we happen to be in. What he said, then, is that while at first we might respond to any given event by the current emotion[^2] we quickly start forming patterns. Patterns that govern our response to similar events, not from the emotion felt, but by the similarity itself.

This is, if true(which I think at the very least requires some additional enquiry), something that is contradictory to what right-wing politics says about human nature: that through reason we find the person lying in wait within, the person waiting for us to discover them. This would also contradict the right-wing idea of society's role in promoting individual growth. If we combine this with the modern view of reason then we find ourselves at a point where right-wing politics seems to be undermined by the truths about human psychology. This is a point that to me seems inescapable, unless we postulate some additional political ideas about how to counter this - which I haven't yet from any person on the right.

Instead I think creating a better political system must involve a change to how we look at society's role in forming us as individuals. Also it must do so always from the basis of what we currently know about human psychology to create that society, in order to help and promote individual progress by working with that psychology and not against it. This would involve such things as changing the fundamental structures of society in order to make it easier for us to observe what our habits are and change them, which in turn changes ourselves for the better.

[^1]: At this point it is worth mentioning that of course left-wing, right-wing, anarchistic etc. politics are not uniform ideologies but they have some common elements running throughout them; and in the context of this discussion I find it does not effect the points that I am trying to make.

[^2]: Because the usage of the word 'emotion' in the context of political discussion is rather controversial I thought that I would explain here what I mean by that word in this context. Here it is not the basis of a rational argument, nor a reason, but only the emotional *response* by any given situation; which is something impossible to deny happens to every situation that befalls us.
