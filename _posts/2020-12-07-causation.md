title: Are causal facts reducible to non-causal facts?

While causal facts cannot *fully* be reduced to non-causal facts there is not only much more
practical value to be had into believing that they are sufficiently reducible, but they are
also much more similar to the actual concept of causation than a non-reducible theory like
Tooley’s primitivist theory.

Let’s start with Tooley, who thought that causation wasn’t reducible to anything other than
causation itself, i.e. that it was a fundamental process. Regularity, probabilities,
counterfactuals and laws are nothing more than ‘make-believe’ in his eyes, something we
tell ourselves are fundamentally real in order to sleep better at night. His argument hinges
on the idea of underdetermination. Say that an object a with two properties at one time,
that later undergoes a change which makes it so that it has two other properties at a later
time. Which of these properties caused which? There is no way of knowing and therefore
Tooley would say that any reducible causal laws *underdetermine* the causal facts.

Kant’s view on causality can help to sort this out and to explain why a reductive theory on
causation better fits with reality. Because of his transcendental idealism worldview Kant
concludes that there is causation and that we are primed to receive it; however our innate
mental concepts about causation and the reality(the transcendent ‘ideal’) do not
necessarily meet up. We can apply an allegory to evolution here and say that we evolved
just enough to be able to grasp the concept of causality to the degree which it is useful to
us. As Kant himself puts it in the second analogy of the Critique :

> “I am therefore only conscious that my imagination places one state before and
> the other after, not that the one state precedes the other in the object, or, in
> other words, through the mere perception the objective relation of the
> appearances that are succeeding one another remains undetermined." . . .
> “Therefore it is only because we subject the sequence of the appearances and
> thus all alteration to the law of causality that experience itself, i.e., empirical
> cognition of them, is possible; consequently they themselves, as objects of
> experience, are possible only in accordance with this law.” (1998, p.304-305)

So while it is true that we cannot - fully - learn causation we can readily learn
it to the
degree it really matters to us, and as such reduce it to laws. And it is necessary that such is
the case, because otherwise we would not be able to make sense of the world around us.

So Tooley is right in that the reductive theories on causation aren’t complete, but I would
argue that reductive theories are not only close enough, but in some cases even too eager.
Lewis’ theory on counterfactual causation showed us that our 'common-sense'(regularity
theory) was incorrect in some cases like preemption and epiphenomenon. Tooley showed
us that causality is underdetermined in some cases, like when we have multiple properties
in one object changing over time. What I argue is that this doesn’t necessarily say much
about our reductive theories of causation being false as much as it tells us about the way in
which we are primed to receive the ‘objective - necessary - causality’ out there, and in the
way that we are overeager to assign causality to events. Reductive theories reflect this
relation better, and explain causal relations better and more accurately than any
non-reductive theory ever could, even if there are some hickups along the way. Is the
purpose in our search for causation to actually find causes or is to sit in the corner sipping
a brandy smugly as you ponder over your water-proof theory that in the end explains
nothing of any causes? If you’re in the former camp you will find solace in a reductive
theory of causation, that in the end will not only solve more problems but also will lead us
closer to the truth about causality. And perhaps it will also lead to a more healthy
relationship to brandy and overly sized chesterfield armchairs.
