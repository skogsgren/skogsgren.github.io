'This Changes Everything' is a book by Naomi Klein, and I think it explains some ideas that I've thought about but not been sure exactly how to express concerning climate change. What follows are simply my notes on Klein's book as I was reading it. Perhaps it is a summary of it, albeit an inherently flawed & unobjective one.

### The Market

> *"If I burned your house the least I can do is welcome you into my house ... and if I'm burning it right now I should try to stop the fire now."*[^1]

We can look on Klein's work as a long critique of capitalism, because unregulated capitalism, to Klein is a system where the rules are decided by those with the least to lose to climate change. Leaving a threat as momentous as climate change up to the free market, a problem which involves shrinking, is not something one can be particularly optimistic about. In unregulated capitalism, in the war between capitalism and the environment, capitalism will always win. The need is for the government to step in and regulate at least crucial parts of the market economy. Pick winners, like renewables over non-renewables; fixing prices in favor of non-consumerism / environmentalism. 

Modern neo-liberalism is also inadequately equipped to deal with climate change. It hinges on the exploitation of third-world countries that we have made more harsh to live and survive in. It is an individualistic mindset, that every country is in it for themselves. That the strong survive and the weak die. If that is true, then we are truly a psychopathic bunch of apes.

While the threat of climate change should bring us together, rich & poor alike, it seems that it only furthers the gap. Protection against increasingly turbulent weather is reserved for the rich as the poor are swept away in stormy wind banks.

For many people, especially billionaries, the idea that capitalism, and only capitalism can solve problems that it helped created is widespread. The thing is that we don't have the time to try it again.

And even when billionaires try to do the "good" thing, like with [Branson](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/sep/13/richard-branson-failed-climate-change-pledge) it will end up failing once the shareholders & executives get a hold of that idea.

The problem, really, is that big companies dependent on the things killing our climate (consumerism, fossile fuel) are still bound by our most fundamental desire: to survive, and making sure that we stay as such. Even if corporations are abstract entities that only exist as a will-of-the-wisp, a few scribbles of ink on some paper locked up in a vault, we treat them --- psychologically --- as something we create, like children, pets or whatever. We project ourselves to them.

### Extractivism

> *"In many pagan societies, the earth was seen as a mother, a fertile giver of life. Nature—the soil, forest, sea—was endowed with divinity, and mortals were subordinate to it. The Judeo-Christian tradition introduced a radically different concept. The earth was the creation of a monotheistic God, who, after shaping it, ordered its inhabitants, in the words of Genesis: “Be fruitful and multiply, and replenish the earth and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea and over the fowl of the air and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth.” The idea of dominion could be interpreted as an invitation to use nature as a convenience"* [^2]

*Extractivism* is the idea that Earth is ours for the taking. It is a dominance relation with nature and its resources. It also extends to human beings: workers to extract every last bit of work out of, "problematic" humans to be locked away --- out of sight, out of mind. Current Western society does not offer an alternative to this extractivist idea.

It is also directly related with the idea of sacrifice "for the common good" (for a select group, of course). This line of thinking plainly has ties to imperialism & notions of racial superiority. In order to have sacrifice zones you need to have groups with no value, hence being morally "allowed" the sacrifice.

The invention of the steam engine and other technologies like it invented --- sort of --- the market economy. They enabled a much faster production of goods, and it became necessary to find a system where those additional goods could be sold. 

Furthermore, currently at least, carbon offsets are sold as commodities on the global markets. Mountains & forests become just another way to make money. A tree is not a tree, but something to appease the conscience of someone a thousand miles away. Thus keeping people spending.

### What Next?

> *"This, without a doubt, is neoliberalism's single most damaging legacy: the realization of its bleak vision has isolated us enough from one another that it became possible to convince us that we are not just incapable of self-preservation but fundamentally **not worth** saving."* p.62
> 
> *"Because to confront this crisis truthfully is to confront ourselves—to reckon, as our ancestors did, with our vulnerability to the elements that make up both the planet and our bodies. It is to accept (even embrace) being but one porous part of the world, rather than its master or machinist, as Bacon long ago promised."* p.175

No money can buy the love for ones nature. Our culture, family is inexorably linked to it. When that becomes a 'sacrifice zone'(i.e. a zone that is sacrificed, climate speaking, for another to prosper) there will be no options other than one: refusal, with no negotiation.

Putting control of nature to companies, and not people dependent and living on the land is sure to lend to a very abusive relationship. The company does not care if the nature becomes unlivable, companies are not alive. 

In order for change to happen alternative must be shown to work. And those most exploited (e.g. indigenous people) by coal/fossil-fuel industry must be the first to do it.

The reason why the solution to the climate crisis is so multifaceted is because the solution affects many areas of life, which necessarily involves fundamental aspects of our current way of life --- which to some is the equivalent of not living. But the fact of the matter is that life has always been about more than objects. It is, fundamentally, about people and our relation to other people.

Just how solving the climate crisis would go about, according to Klein: 

> *"Living nonextractively does not mean that extraction does not happen: all living things must take from nature in order to survive. But it does mean the end of the extractivist mindset—of taking without caretaking, of treating land and people as resources to deplete rather than as complex entities with rights to a dignified existence based on renewal and regeneration. Even such traditionally destructive practices as logging can be done responsibly, as can small-scale mining, particularly when the activities are controlled by the people who live where the extraction is taking place and who have a stake in the ongoing health and productivity of the land. But most of all, living nonextractively means relying overwhelmingly on resources that can be continuously regenerated: deriving our food from farming methods that protect soil fertility; our energy from methods that harness the ever-renewing strength of the sun, wind, and waves; our metals from recycled and reused sources."* p.447
